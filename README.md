# sql-database-project
## Final SQL Project - Shop

### Project Requirements:
* You must create a database and populate it with records.
* The database must contain several tables (>= 3) with properly defined primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, etc.
* You must create at least two roles and grant them permissions.
* You must write at least one meaningful function and create at least one view.

The project should be completed in the form of two .sql files (with comments!). 
In one file, you should create the database, i.e., tables, views, etc., 
and in the second, present its contents, i.e., write several sample queries 
that utilize the solutions you have created.
